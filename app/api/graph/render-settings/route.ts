 * threshold, the cluster-labels toggle). The file lives at
 * data/render-settings.json (config.RENDER_SETTINGS_FILE).
 *
 *   GET → 200 {settings} once saved, 200 null on first boot (client keeps
 *         in-memory defaults until the user changes something).
 *   PUT → 200 {settings} (the sanitized copy actually persisted — the
 *         client may echo it to stay honest with clamped values).
 *
 * Every body is passed through sanitizeRenderSettings (src/core) before
 * touching disk: garbage clamps or falls back to defaults, never throws.
