/**
 * PUT /api/graph/positions — the live-physics drag commit. The client
 * anneals a drag to rest and sends the new positions; the server
 * sanitizes (finite coords, known ids only), writes the ledger, and if
 * the graph grew mid-drag runs one incremental settle to absorb the new
 * nodes with the client's arrangement as anchors. See
 * src/server/commit-positions.ts.
 *
 *   PUT → 200 {positions: {...}} with whatever survived sanitizing
 *         (empty object = nothing written).
