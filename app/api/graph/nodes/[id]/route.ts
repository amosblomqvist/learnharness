/**
 * DELETE /api/graph/nodes/[id] — single-node deletion, FULL DEATH (owner
 * ruling 2026-09-23: the user pointing at the node is intent — references
 * from other sessions do not preserve it). The node's every line, every
 * edge touching it, every quiz/observation event naming it, its mapping
 * lines, and its position die in one atomic ledger rewrite
 * (core/graph-deletion.ts deleteNodeTraces); derived data (birth
 * partition, clusters) self-heals on read.
 *
 * Guards (server/graph.ts deleteGraphNode): 409 while ANY extraction run
 * is registered — a mid-flight run holds pre-deletion findings and could
 * re-reference the dying node; the run is never aborted (its spend belongs
 * to another session), the UI retries once the dock drains. No turn/jobs
 * gates: they never write the graph ledgers, and this orchestration is
 * synchronous end to end — nothing interleaves. The response carries what
 * was removed plus the new graphRevision (the refetch signal).
