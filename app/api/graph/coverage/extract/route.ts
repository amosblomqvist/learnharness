/**
 * POST /api/graph/coverage/extract — the manual extraction affordance
 * (vision-extraction-coverage.md): run the pipeline over ONE session's
 * uncovered content, whatever its size — the user's answer to an aborted
 * run, a pipeline error, or a session that went dormant under the chunk
 * budget. The pipeline itself batches under the graph.extractionChunkTokens setting (extraction-UX redesign,
 * 2026-09-24) and
 * checkpoints coverage per merged batch, so this is the same run the
 * trigger fires, just user-initiated. 409 while a run is already in
 * flight (the dock is the source of truth for that); failures are logged
 * by the pipeline and leave coverage untouched — the button stays honest.
