 *
 *   preserve-graph  the session record, its jobs, and its extraction
 *                   bookkeeping (coverage/checkpoint rows) die; the graph
 *                   keeps every contribution the session merged.
 *   delete-nodes    "this session never happened": every ledger trace of
 *                   the session goes too — provenance, link lines,
 *                   events, mappings — and orphaned nodes die entirely
 *                   (shared nodes survive automatically, their other
 *                   sessions' content intact).
 *
 * Gates are the server orchestration's (server/chats.ts deleteChatSession):
 * 409 while a turn or background job is running, 503 while the session's
 * extraction is winding down after its abort — both retryable. The
 * response carries what was removed plus the new graphRevision (the
 * version stamp the UI polls to refetch clusters/layout).
