/**
 * The in-session phase presentation (owner, minimal-color round —
 * monochrome now): the header chip next to the session title, and the
 * dotted boundary rule the transcript draws where the session moves into a
 * new phase. Phase COLOR is retired app-wide (phases only advance, so
 * color-as-signal was decoration); the label text carries the phase, and
 * the chip's old dot slot is repurposed for the braille spinner while a
 * turn is in flight — motion is the honest state signal. Replaces the old
 * inline plan-divider (artifact registry): the boundary is a MESSAGE-level
 * seam, so chat.tsx renders it at the message where the phase changes, not
 * inside a tool part.
 *
 * Quiet register (matches the old divider): hairline rules, small chips —
 * never a banner. Probe never renders a divider: phases only advance, so
 * probe is the start of the transcript and "Planning"/"Teaching" are the two
 * visible seams.
 *
 * Owner, minimal-color round 2: the chip is LABEL-ONLY, deliberately — a
 * working-state spinner was tried here and rejected: the pill's curve and
 * the square braille cell fought for space, and the chat surface already
 * shows in-flight work (thinking shimmer, the dock). The chip states the
 * phase; work-state is the sidebar row's spinner.
