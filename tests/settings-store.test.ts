/**
 * Tests for the settings STORE (settings-storage wave, 2026-09-19):
 * src/store/settings.ts — the record's fs adapter. Writes the real repo
 * data/ files (npm test's shared data/, disposable scratch by doctrine)
 * and cleans up after itself; a pre-existing settings.json is snapshotted
 * and restored so the worktree's own dev state survives the run.
 *
 * (The legacy default-settings.json fold and the chat-section facade died
 * with per-session models, owner 2026-09-28 — sessions own their model
 * from birth, stamped from the strong slot server-side.)
