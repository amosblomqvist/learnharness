# Golden fixtures — real user data, read through production paths

**The law (owner ruling, 2026-10-10):** this directory is a REAL data dir —
verbatim records written by the real application code, never hand-edited. Any
intentional on-disk format change updates these fixtures IN THE SAME COMMIT;
an unintentional change fails `tests/golden-fixtures.test.ts`. When schema
stamps land (Wave D), the stamping commit updates these files with it.

`tests/golden-fixtures.test.ts` copies this dir to a temp dir, points the
production stores at it via the `LH_DATA_DIR` seam, and reads EVERYTHING
through the real read paths — chat records (contract folds + the LLM wire
flattening), graph ledgers (shape guards + the full derivation), jobs,
settings. It also pins marker COVERAGE: every custom-marker kind and the
core tool surface must appear in real data here.

## What's inside

- `chats/chat_mv27rrra_feff23b6.json` — the teach-side master (owner-built,
  2026-10-10): probe-handoff, plan-block, compaction, subagent-steer,
  subagent-abort, and every teach tool (quiz, ask_user_question, plan_init,
  probe, probe_done, recall, explain, research, demo, visual, pdf, find,
  grep, ls, read, list_sessions, list_propositions). Plan tree + 25 turn
  records + a per-chat model override.
- `chats/chat_mv293wv5_10656952.json` — the practice lifecycle (owner-built,
  2026-10-10): graph-context (the bracketed preamble), problem ×2,
  practice-thinking ×2, conclude ×2, practice-next, problem-dismissed — the
  full marker cycle of a practice session, including the dismissal.
- `chats/chat_mvr8o176_c6aa9462.json` captures initial probe completion,
  plan presentation, a `plan_review` answer requesting further diagnostic,
  and `resume_probe`. Captured on 2026-10-27 through `handleChatInput`, the
  actual prober/teacher factories and `chatStore`, with an isolated data
  directory and a scripted Pi faux provider. The source record was copied
  byte-for-byte after settlement, without hand-editing. It contains no
  learner account, credential or live-provider output.
- `graph/` — the real ledgers: nodes (282 lines), chains (160), sessions (8),
  coverage (93), sources (4), render-settings, positions.
- `jobs/` — five records covering kind × status: research done + aborted by
  learner, demo done, visual done, pdf error.
- `settings.json` — the stamped settings record (version 1, model slots).

## Regenerating / extending

Run the app (`npm run dev`), exercise the feature against `data/`, then copy
the produced record in verbatim. Do not hand-edit content; if a record needs
pruning, re-run the flow instead.

## Stamps

These files are deliberately the UNSTAMPED legacy shape (schema-stamp wave,
2026-10-10): lazy v1 means absence reads as current-valid, so this set pins
the pre-stamp read path forever. Stamped writes (chat `version: 1`, the
`graph/format.json` sidecar) are pinned by `tests/schema-stamps.test.ts`.
New records copied in after their first post-stamp write will carry the
stamps — that shape is equally current-valid.
