/**
 * The search-provider port (search port + model slots wave, 2026-09-20).
 *
 * Search engines are pluggable behind ONE seam: the settings record names a
 * preferred engine (agent.search.engine — optional), keys live in the auth
 * store (the curated key catalog), and the server composes the live adapter.
 *
 * Owner decisions baked here:
 *  - NO default engine in the factory record: an engine is live iff its
 *    key is present. With a key, the engine auto-activates (the user never
 *    chooses an engine to make search work — setting the key is enough);
 *    agent.search.engine is only an explicit preference.
 *  - Nothing silently falls back: no engine live = search is honestly
 *    unavailable (the tool says so; the researcher sub-agent is disabled
 *    by the agent layer on the same signal — that rewiring is the Teacher
 *    stream's, on this port).
 *
 * Pure types + protocol docs only (browser-safe, no node imports): the
 * adapters are server-side (src/server/search.ts) and arrive as injected
 * dependencies — the agent-layer tool depends on THIS port only.
