/**
 * Probe-phase contracts (the probe→teach split, docs/probe-teach-split.md).
 *
 * The prober concludes its phase with `probe_done` — a server-side tool
 * whose INPUT is the learner assessment (authored by the model, streamed to
 * the learner live, durable in the transcript by the tool result itself).
 * A successful `probe_done` concludes the current diagnostic. The teacher
 * is selected until diagnostic reopens, and the tool's execute
 * queues the handoff steer through the wake pipeline so the teacher starts
 * immediately after the prober's turn ends (auto-wake, user-decided).
 *
 * Assessment shape (v1 — refine later): the probe was a binary search per
 * dependency strand; the assessment formalizes exactly that. A list of the
 * strands the lesson will depend on, each with a free-form read of where
 * the learner's edge sits.
