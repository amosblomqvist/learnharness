 * Shared contracts — the single source of truth every component codes against.

 * Split by domain (src/core/contracts/): plan.ts (the session plan tree),
 * graph.ts (the global knowledge graph + its extraction pipeline), chat.ts
 * (session records + UI extension points), jobs.ts (the async sub-agent
 * protocol),  Each domain file is
 * owned outright by its stream; schema changes to a domain you don't own go
 * through master. This barrel keeps every existing import path
