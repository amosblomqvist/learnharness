/**
 * Delete one node by id — FULL DEATH (core/graph-deletion.ts for the
 * ledger semantics). The guard family is deliberately NOT the chat
 * one, and the reasoning is worth writing down:
 *
 *   - No turn/jobs gates. Turns and background jobs never write the
 *     graph ledgers; a turn's follow-up extraction registers as a run,
 *     and every code path here is synchronous — nothing can register
 *     or merge between the gate and the ledger rewrite (the event loop
 *     never yields inside this function).
 *   - THE EXTRACTION GATE — 409 while ANY pipeline run is registered,
 *     anywhere. A mid-flight run holds findings extracted from
 *     transcripts that predate the deletion; its merges could re-add
 *     aliases, provenance, or events to the dying node (the
 *     re-reference risk the dispatch flags). Unlike chat deletion we
 *     do NOT abort the run: it belongs to some session, and killing
 *     that session's spend is outside this deletion's blast radius —
 *     the UI retries once the dock drains. A run that starts AFTER
 *     the deletion is legitimate re-learning: it reads post-deletion
 *     ledgers, mints a fresh node for a re-taught topic, and
 *     mergeFindings ignores linkTo ids that no longer exist (the
 *     existingIds guard) — no dangling edges, no resurrection.
