/**
 * The chat-turn services — one named seam per turn
 * responsibility, extracted from the chat-handler so it composes instead of
 * implementing. Each takes its dependencies explicitly (storage ports, the
 * job runner) — no module here imports an adapter.
 *
 *   persistTurn        — the canonical state write (Wave B: native history;
 *                        id stamping, placeholder filtering, plan-block
 *                        emission, abort-partial persistence)
 *   triggerExtraction  — the graph write channel: fires the extraction
 *                        pipeline (the sole graph writer) once a chat
 *                        crosses the token-budget threshold.
 *
 * Logs are the minimal-observability baseline: one line per failure, tagged
 * [chat <id>] — structured logging lands behind these seams later.

 * — the partial transcript (including a pending question's unanswered
 * call) is what makes resume work.
 *
 * - Id stamping: pi messages carry no id; the record's identity needs one
 *   per message (client keys, append-only adoption, the continuation
 *   seam). Minted here, at the single canonical write.
 * - Placeholder filtering: a cleanly-posed question's synthetic
 *   "question posed" result is an in-memory loop device (Wave A's
 *   terminate) — NEVER persisted (fork 1: the record ends at the
 *   unanswered call; the learner's answer arrives as the real tool
 *   result). Errored question calls DO persist — the model's retry
 *   context.
 * - Plan blocks: one frozen snapshot per successful plan_init call,
 *   idempotent (persist replays are safe).
 *
 * Returns the stamped new messages (usage provenance reads them). Throws
 * TurnPersistenceError on failure so the runner can report it before DONE.
