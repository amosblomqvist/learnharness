/**
 * THE NOTIFICATION CHANNEL (push-architecture slice 1): GET /api/events is
 * an SSE response over the core event bus — one connection per open
 * window, held open until the view goes away, fed by every emitter
 * (turn lifecycle, job/chat stores, extraction registry).
 *
 * NOTIFY → FETCH (the architecture's whole trick): frames carry only the
 * event type + a tiny payload; consumers respond by fetching truth
 * (/api/chats/:id, /api/jobs, /api/activity). No payload versioning, no
 * replay protocol — a reconnect resyncs with one ordinary fetch per
 * consumer. This is a DESKTOP app talking to localhost: holding N≈1-3
 * connections costs one socket pair each and zero traffic while idle
 * (owner ruling 2026-10-02 — polling's cloud economics don't exist at
 * loopback; the poll lattice it left behind is what this replaces).
 *
 * Wire dialect mirrors the turn stream (pi/ui-stream.ts): text/event-stream,
 * no-cache/no-transform, X-Accel-Buffering off — plus a `: ping` comment
 * every 25s to keep any intermediary from idling the socket out (locally
 * unnecessary, harmless, and it makes dead-connection detection cheap).
 *
 * The DIFFERENCE from the turn stream is lifetime: a turn's stream ends at
 * settle ([DONE]); this channel ends when the CLIENT goes away — cancel()
 * is the only end, and it must leave the bus untouched for other windows.
 * The closure shape (teardown assigned in start, called in cancel) is the
 * ui-stream subscribe() pattern.
