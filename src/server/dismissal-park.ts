/**
 * PARKED DISMISSALS (owner, 2026-10-04): ESC-discard while the turn is
 * still working. Mid-turn the STORED record holds no pending question or
 * problem (the turn hasn't persisted — its messages land at settle), so a
 * dismissal arriving now CANNOT validate; the old behavior was a hard 409,
 * which left the learner trapped with a phantom question until the turn
 * died (the GLM practice-loop incident: the only escape was killing the
 * dev server).
 *
 * The park (owner ruling: "server-side park"): the dismiss route, finding
 * a live turn, parks the intent and answers 202; the turn's settle path
 * (chat-handler onFinish, AFTER persistTurn, BEFORE endTurn — the same
 * ordering law that makes turn-settled imply durable truth) applies it
 * against the freshly persisted record. Validation runs at APPLY time
 * against real state: if the dismissed question/problem really is pending
 * there, the dismissal lands exactly as the route would have written it;
 * if it never materialized (the call errored, the model re-posed and
 * answered), the park is dropped silently — the thing the user dismissed
 * no longer exists.
 *
 * Lives on globalThis, NOT a module-level Map — the same Next.js module
 * instance discipline as turn-liveness: the dismiss route and the
 * chat-handler entry must see the SAME registry or the park is written in
 * one world and read in another. Ephemeral by design; one parked
 * dismissal per chat (last write wins — there is one dock, one discard).
