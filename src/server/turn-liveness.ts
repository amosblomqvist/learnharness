/**
 * Server-side turn liveness: which chats currently have a teacher turn in
 * flight. The missing half of "sessions keep running in the background" —
 * together with the write-ahead persist in chat-handler, a returning client
 * can tell "the teacher is mid-turn — don't resurrect, don't start anything"
 * apart from "the record IS current".
 *
 * Lives on globalThis, NOT a module-level Map: Next dev compiles each route
 * as its own entry, so a module-level singleton is a DIFFERENT instance in
 * the page render, GET /api/chats/[id], and POST /api/chat — the page would
 * read an empty registry while the chat route holds the live turn (the bug:
 * returning mid-turn showed the 409 banner instead of the busy state).
 * globalThis spans module instances within the process; it is the standard
 * Next.js singleton channel (same reason Prisma clients live there).
 *
 * Still ephemeral BY DESIGN: a process restart clears it, so there are no
 * stale flags to clean up — a crashed turn recovers via the write-ahead
 * record + mount continuation on the next visit. The TTL is a leak guard for
 * the pathological case where onFinish never fires (it runs even on aborts);
 * chat turns are minutes at most, so 30 minutes is far on the safe side.
